Download the latest stable release called motioneyeos-[board]-yyyymmdd.img.gz, where [board] is the name of your board

extract the image file from the archive

write the image file to your SD card:

If you use Windows, just follow these instructions.


First Boot
When booting a fresh image installation, a few initialization steps will take place and therefore the system won't be ready for about 1-2 minutes. Please do not disconnect or reboot your board during these first two minutes!. These steps are:

preparing the data partition on the SD card
configuring SSH remote access
auto-configuring any detected camera devices
motionEyeOS needs an IP address before you can communicate with it so you'll have to use the ethernet connection with DHCP enabled, unless you have preconfigured a static IP address.

As soon as your motionEyeOS is ready it will listen on port 80 and present you a web user interface. To access it, enter the IP address of your board in the address bar of your browser. To find the address, connect to your router (most routers can display the addresses of all connected devices) and look for a device name beginning with "meye-". Alternatively, you can use a network scanner such as the free mobile app Fing.

Click on the user icon on the upper-left side of the page to switch user to administrator. Use admin with no password when asked for credentials. Feel free to explore all the available configuration options.

Things you will need first:

Win32DiskImager

DO NOT EJECT THE SD CARD yet.
Open Windows Explorer and browse to your drive containing the microSD card. You should see files such as:

Right-click in the right window pane and select New Text Document.
Now, right click on this file and rename it wpa_supplicant.conf. Make sure to remove the .txt file extension.
Once again, right click on this file and select Edit with Notepad++.
Make sure you set the EOL conversion to UNIX LineFeeds (Edit-->EOL Conversion-->Unix LF).
Paste the following contents into your blank file (obviously changing the ssid and psk to match yours):

        update_config=1
        ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
        
        network={

            psk="S3cr3tp@$$w0rc|"
        }
Change the country code to the country in which this device is currently operating. You can get the list of country codes here.
Save the file.
Eject your microSD card safely.
Insert this microSD card into your device, e.g. Pi 4
Optionally, attach a camera to your device.
Apply power to your device.
If you have a monitor attached to the device, you should see the wireless network service starting, wpa_supplicant being read and 'brcmfmac Done'.
Shortly, you should see your IP address being displayed along with your gateway and DNS servers.
Using your favorite browser, browse to the IP address that was displayed and log in to the device using the default motioneyeos credentials of: admin / [blank password]
You can shut down the motioneye os remotely by select the advanced settings-->shutdown
Note: If you do not have a display attached to your zero, you can use nmap to scan your home network for any new devices / ip's. Look for one labeled "(Raspberry Pi Foundation)"
